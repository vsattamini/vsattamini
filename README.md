# Victor Sattamini

**Senior AI/ML Engineer** | Production LLM Systems | AI Safety Research | Multi-Agent Architectures

Building production AI backends that actually work. Research focus on alignment evaluation and agent cognition.

## What I Build

**Production AI Systems**
- End-to-end LLM backends serving 10K+ users
- Multi-phase extraction pipelines with weighted signal scoring
- Semantic matching systems (vector search + hard filters + LLM reranking)
- Async FastAPI services with background sync workers

**Agent Architectures**
- ReAct-based agent loops with dynamic tool creation
- Multi-agent orchestration and delegation systems
- Custom observability for production LLM monitoring

**AI Safety Research**
- Alignment evaluation frameworks (500+ adversarial scenarios)
- Behavioral analysis of LLMs under conflicting objectives
- Published research on LLM cognition and ethical decision-making

## Featured Projects
### [research-assistant-mcp](https://github.com/vsattamini/research-assistant-mcp)
MCP proxy implementing research workflow orchestration. Python-based agent coordination with structured output handling.

### [document-signals](https://github.com/vsattamini/document-signals) *(In Development)*
Multi-phase LLM extraction pipeline for structured signal analysis. Demonstrates production patterns: async orchestration, weighted scoring with time decay, vector embeddings, and semantic matching.

### [alignment-evals](https://github.com/vsattamini/alignment-evals) *(In Development)*
Open-source LLM alignment evaluation framework. 500+ adversarial scenarios covering behavioral breakdown points, deception detection, and self-preservation analysis.

### [agent-orchestrator](https://github.com/vsattamini/agent-orchestrator) *(In Development)*
Production-grade multi-agent framework with ReAct loops, dynamic tool creation, and LangFuse observability. Built in parrallel with my Master's thesis on multi-agent architectures.
